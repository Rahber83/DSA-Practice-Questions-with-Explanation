# Explanation of solutionFirstOfPatternOne

The function solutionFirstOfPatternOne prints a grid of asterisks. It takes a single parameter n, which specifies the number of rows and columns in the grid.

2. **Detailed Steps:**
   Function Definition: The function is defined to accept one argument, n, which determines the size of the grid.

3. **Outer Loop:**
   The outer loop runs n times. Each iteration of this loop represents one row of the grid.

4. **Inner Loop:**
   Inside the outer loop, there is another loop that also runs n times. This inner loop is responsible for printing the asterisks for each column in the current row.

5. **Printing Asterisks:**
   Within the inner loop, an asterisk (_) is printed without moving to a new line. This is achieved using process.stdout.write("_"). This method allows the asterisks to be printed consecutively on the same line.

6. **New Line After Each Row:**
   After the inner loop completes (i.e., after printing all asterisks for the current row), console.log() is used to move to the next line. This ensures that the next row of asterisks starts on a new line.

7. **Function Call:**
   The function is executed with n = 5, resulting in a 5x5 grid of asterisks being printed.

# Explanation of solutionSecondOfPatternOne

1. **Function Overview:**
   The function solutionSecondOfPatternOne is designed to print a grid of asterisks. It takes a single parameter n, which specifies the number of rows and columns in the grid.

2. **Detailed Steps:**
   Function Definition: The function is defined to accept one argument, n, which determines the grid size.

3. **Row Construction:**
   A string named row is created that consists of n asterisks. This is achieved using the repeat() method on the asterisk character ("\*"). This string represents a single row of the grid.

4. **Loop to Print Rows:**
   A for loop runs n times. In each iteration, the row string is printed, resulting in n rows of asterisks.

5. **Function Call:**
   The function is called with n = 6, resulting in a 6x6 grid of asterisks being printed.
