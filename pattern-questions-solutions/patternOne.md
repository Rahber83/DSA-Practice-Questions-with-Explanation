# Explanation of `solutionFirstOfPatternOne` Function

The `solutionFirstOfPatternOne` function prints a grid of asterisks (`*`). It takes a single parameter `n`, which specifies the number of rows and columns in the grid.

1. **Function Definition:** The function is defined to accept one argument, `n`, which determines the size of the grid.

-2.**Outer Loop:** The outer loop `for (let i = 0; i < n; i++)` runs `n` times. Each iteration of this loop represents one row of the grid.

3. **Inner Loop:** Inside the outer loop, there is another loop `for (let j = 0; j < n; j++)` that also runs `n` times. This inner loop is responsible for printing the asterisks for each column in the current row.

4. **Printing Asterisks:** Within the inner loop, an asterisk (`*`) is printed without moving to a new line. This is achieved using `process.stdout.write("*")`. This method allows the asterisks to be printed consecutively on the same line.

5. **New Line After Each Row:** After the inner loop completes (i.e., after printing all asterisks for the current row), `console.log()` is used to move to the next line. This ensures that the next row of asterisks starts on a new line.

6. **Function Call:** The function is executed with `n = 5`, resulting in a 5x5 grid of asterisks being printed.

# Explanation of `solutionSecondOfPatternOne` Function

The `solutionSecondOfPatternOne` function is designed to print a grid of asterisks (`*`). It takes a single parameter `n`, which specifies the number of rows and columns in the grid.

1. **Function Definition:** The function is defined to accept one argument, `n`, which determines the grid size.

2. **Row Construction:** A string named `row` is created that consists of `n` asterisks. This is achieved using the `repeat(n)` method on the asterisk character (`"*"`). This string represents a single row of the grid.

3. **Loop to Print Rows:** A `for` loop `for (let i = 0; i < n; i++)` runs `n` times. In each iteration, the `row` string is printed, resulting in `n` rows of asterisks.

4. **Function Call:** The function is called with `n = 6`, resulting in a 6x6 grid of asterisks being printed.
