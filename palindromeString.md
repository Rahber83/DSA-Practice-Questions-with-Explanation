# Explanation of the palindromeString.js file Two pointer Method

## Problem: `Palindrome String` â€“

1. **Method Description:**

   - The method used here is called the "Two Pointer Method". This technique involves using two pointers that start at opposite ends of the string and move towards the center, comparing characters at each step.

2. **Input:**

   - `let palindromeString = "maa";`  
     This line initializes a variable `palindromeString` with the value `"maa"`. This is the string that will be checked for palindrome-ness.

3. **Function Declaration:**
   const stringPalindrome = (palindromeString) => {

   - This defines a function named `stringPalindrome` that takes a parameter `palindromeString`.

4. **String Manipulation:**
   palindromeString = palindromeString.toLowerCase().replace(/[^a-z0-9]/g, '');

   - This line converts the string to lowercase using `.toLowerCase()`. This ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive.
   - The `.replace(/[^a-z0-9]/g, '')` part uses a regular expression to remove any characters that are not alphanumeric (`[^a-z0-9]` matches anything that is not a lowercase letter or a digit). This step removes spaces and special characters.

5. **Pointers Initialization:**
   let i = 0;
   let j = palindromeString.length - 1;

   - Two pointers, `i` and `j`, are initialized. `i` starts at the beginning of the string (index 0) and `j` starts at the end of the string (index `length - 1`).

6. **Palindrome Checking:**
   while (i < j) {
   if(palindromeString[i] !== palindromeString[j]){
   return "String is Not Palindrome"
   }
   i++;
   j--;
   }

   - This `while` loop continues until `i` is less than `j`. It means that the loop will run until the two pointers meet in the middle.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if the characters at `i` and `j` are not equal. If they are not, it means that the string is not a palindrome, so it immediately returns `"String is Not Palindrome"`.
   - After the comparison, both `i` and `j` are incremented and decremented respectively to move towards the center of the string.

7. **Return Statements:**

   - If the loop completes without finding any unequal characters, it means that the string is a palindrome. In this case, it returns `"String is Palindrome"`.

8. **Function Call:**
   console.log(stringPalindrome(palindromeString));

   - This line calls the `stringPalindrome` function with the input `palindromeString` and logs the result to the console.

9. **Output:**
   - Depending on whether the input string is a palindrome or not, it will print either `"String is Palindrome"` or `"String is Not Palindrome"`.
